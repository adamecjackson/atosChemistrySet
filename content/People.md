## Teams
Extreme Programming works well in small teams, sized between approximately 3 and 11 people. Although I've seen larger teams they often suffer from communication and concurrency issues. If your team grows beyond these bounds - divide it into smaller teams. If you have a large problem that cannot be solved by a small team, divide it into a series of smaller problems.

XP teams can be seen as like organic cells: expanding, contracting, splitting, and dying - as the environment dictates. Carefully considering the nature of the teams as they grow and divide can have useful/interesting repercussions due to [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law).

Each team should be focused on quantifiable business outcomes if possible. This makes product ownership a much easier task as the metrics for success and failure are usually clearer and easier to gather. This also help ensure teams are delivering value.

Each team should have a good mix of skills and experience. A team of all junior developers can sometimes result in poor architectural decisions. A team of all senior developers can result in "bike sheding" and long-running architectural debates, with little forward progress.

## Lifestyle
XP teams should co-locate if possible and work overlapping hours. This means each team should decide on a fourty-hour working week and only work those hours. This helps to create a sustainable development environment, reduce burnout, and limit churn.

Engineer rotation between teams is useful to share knowledge, reduce team speciation, encourage inter-team empathy, and retain staff by providing variety.

XP is of no use without good people in the teams. Cherish your good staff; without them your organisation is nothing.

## Roles

### Product Owner
- CEO of the product
- Owns the product vision and direction
- Prioritises backlog
- Accepts or rejects features (experiments)
- Works with engineers on outlining features
- Works with customers and stakeholders
- Understands metrics for success

### Anchor
- Custodian of the process
- Responsible for the "flow"
- Less likely to rotate (hence the name)
- Works closely with Product Owner refining the backlog

### Engineer

- Test-driven development
- "Build quality in"
- Enough architecture
