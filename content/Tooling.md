## Location / environment

One of the core XP values is communication, and as such co-locating teams is the right way to go if at all possible. Constant feedback and communication between the Product Owner and the engineers builds a better product.

A colocated XP space should have pairing stations for development, the Product Owner nearby, and available areas so team members can step away from their desks for calls and emails. It should be a pleasant environment to work in and provide the best tools to get the job done. Show respect for your team by making them happy.

All workstations in a team should be consistent to reduce friction when rotating pairs. We thoroughly recommend using automated configuration management for deterministic consistency of development machines, with each team iterating on their own development setup.

The team should have their own board to clearly illustrate pairings, interruptible pairs if appropriate, records retro items, and show when people are out of the office.

There should also be table tennis or football available near to the working area to build team relationships and reduce stress. Pair programming is intense, requiring frequent and regular breaks. Table tennis is good for your health.

## Remote working

Remote working is suboptimal, as it prohibits effective communication, but sometimes necessary. Always start with co-located teams to facilitate communication and build effective relationships, even if you then have to distribute the team.

The best tooling we have found so far for remote pairing is:

- Slack
- Appear.in
- Screenhero

Invest in headsets, webcams, and condenser mics/speakers for meeting rooms. Quality of internet connectivity is usually the determining factor as to the success of remote pairing. If you can't video conference, you're likely to have great difficulty collaborating effectively.
