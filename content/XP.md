## Why Extreme Programming(XP)

### Lowering the cost of experimentation

Influential books such as [The Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) and [Four Steps to the Epiphany](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steven-Blank/dp/0976470705) are based upon the idea that whoever can receive fastest feedback in an uncertain market will be the most successful. Traditional businesses are being disrupted by continuous innovators. XP embraces change so is a great fit for technology companies looking to out-learn their competition.

### XP Values

- Courage
- Communication
- Respect
- Feedback
- Simplicity

We use these values to evaluate our process and the tools in our chemistry set.

### Why not Scrum, Kanban, Six Sigma, etc.

XP is a fantantastic methodology when learning is paramount and uncertainty is high. Highly agile methodologies such as XP focus on reducing feedback latency so as to minimise the cost of experimentation. As you gain knowledge about your customers and environment you may look to increase efficiency and reduce waste in your process, moving to [lean methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing). As your product moves towards becoming a commodity, and is essentially mass-produced, you may look at processes such as [Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma) to minimise deviation.

Deciding which methodology to use in which circumstance can be difficult. Tools such as [Wardley Mapping](http://www.wardleymaps.com/) can be very helpful in this process. The following metrics are often useful when considering which methodology to use:

- batch size
- desired feedback latency
- deviation
- cost of change
- cost of failure
- certainty on requirements

A word of warning here: whenever I ask product managers how certain they are about their market, or their requirements, they always respond that they are absolutely certain they have the correct requirements. 'Certainty on requirements' in this instance refers to validated knowledge, ie. emperical evidence exists to substantiate the requirements. This is ususally in the form of a current product or service that is successful. Any new development is better suited to agile methodologies such as XP.

## The Pivotal Way and XP

A large proportion of the information here has been learned through interactions and iterations with Pivotal. Thanks, Pivotal!

## Cloud Foundry and XP

Cloud Foundry's incredibly fast Time-To-Value(TTV) dramatically lowers the cost of experimentation for application development. This makes Cloud Foundry an ideal fit for XP.

To use a bad analogy - you were on a horse, now you're in a race car. XP teaches you to drive with your eyes open.
