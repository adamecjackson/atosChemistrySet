This site is a set of principles, patterns, and tools to help you learn about your environment. These tools can help you build an engine for experimentation, so you can iterate quickly towards successful products, services, and software.

The basis for our learning is [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). These concepts have been echoed in approaches such as the [Deming Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) and the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop). The underlying pattern is to gain validated knowledge by using evidence to test hypotheses. The faster we can test our ideas, iterate, and gain knowledge, the greater our level of knowledge will become.

The emphasis here should be 'people over process' - please discuss and evaluate the information here with your colleagues and do not adopt the process in a dogmatic fashion.

If your environment doesn't allow for experimentation, due to constraints such as high cost of failure, this might not be the right set of patterns for you. Hopefully you can use these patterns to lower the cost of failure in your environment so you have more courage to experiment. Try things out.
